## Part 1 - 2D representation of shooting system
The triangle represents a Spaceship which can be controlled by the player using arrow keys. The hexagons represent the enemies which you have to shoot by pressing spacebar. 
The enemies are drawn using sin and cos functions around the center, dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides (in our case, 6). The movement of the enemies is done by applying a transform to the
hexagons using an array of positions, which depend on speed and phase.
